    - How to calculate the CO_2 saved by using EV/PV instead of
      traditional fossil fuels.

   - PV[fn:2]={C/((1+r)^t)}[fn:3]

*** Discount rate and Inflation
    - Comparability
    - Factors
      - Productivity p%/yr
      - CPI i%/yr
    - DR = minimum acceptable profitability

*** Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)
    - A basic way of estimating DR
    - Does NOT
      - Reflect opportunity cost
    - 

*** Company raising capital
    - Debt
    - Equity

*** WACC Overview
    - Does *not* account for project risk
    - Does *not* account for opportunity risk

*** Evaluation Methods
    - Break Even
    - Net Present Value
    - internal value of return
    - Levelized Cost of Energy: constant unit cost of a payment
      stream that has same present value as the total cost of
      building and operating.

*** Energy Infrastructure
    - large-scale and cheap energy provision is a key ingredient
    - very messy, very fast

*** Climate change basics
    - we will reach the point no return, if the temperature rises just
      2 degree.

*** Weather vs Climate
    -

*** Sustainable Energy
    - Energy resources
    - Energy uses
    - Energy regulation
    - Climate change and pollution

*** Masdar Institute's Goal
    - Educating Energy Practitioners[fn:4]

*** How will we move forward?
    - Core set of guiding principles
    - Ongoing dialogue
    - Participation of diverse stakeholders and perspectives.

*** Key Definitions
    - Energy: Capacity of a system to do work (“cause external
      action”)
    - Power: Rate at which work is performed or energy is transmitted

*** Three Dimensions of Sustainability
    - Finance, economy
    - Equity social development
    - Ecology environment

*** Sustainable Development
    - But the “environment” is where we live; and “development” is
      what we all do in attempting to improve our lot within that
      abode. The two are inseparable.

* Footnotes

[fn:1] Full-load hours: Whereas capacity factor is an indication of
capacity utilization as a percentage, one also speaks of "full-load
hours," an especially useful term for dispatchable generators, which
can be switched on and off – such as biomass, coal, natural gas, and
nuclear.  

[fn:2] Present Value

[fn:3] Updated equation. 

[fn:4] We do energy stuff and we are proud of that.
